%% Simulink Model
% This model controls the level of water in a tank using a fuzzy inference
% system implemented using a Fuzzy Logic Controller block. Open
% the |sltank| model.
open_system('sltank')
fuzzy('tank.fis')
%%
% For this system, you control the water that flows into the tank using a
% valve. The outflow rate depends on the diameter of the output pipe, which
% is constant, and the pressure in the tank, which varies with water level.
% Therefore, the system has nonlinear characteristics.

%% Fuzzy Inference System
% The fuzzy system is defined in a FIS object, |tank|, in the MATLAB(R)
% workspace. For more information on how to specify a FIS in a Fuzzy Logic
% Controller block, see <docid:fuzzy.bvkr4k8 Fuzzy Logic Controller>.
%
% The two inputs to the fuzzy system are the water level error, |level|,
% and the rate of change of the water level, |rate|. Each input has three
% membership functions.

%%
% The output of the fuzzy system is the rate at which the control valve is
% opening or closing, |valve|, which has five membership functions.
plotmf(tank,'output',1)

%%
% Due to the diameter of the outflow pipe, the water tank in this system
% empties more slowly than it fills up. To compensate for this imbalance,
% the |close_slow| and |open_slow| valve membership functions are not
% symmetrical. A PID controller does not support such asymmetry.

%%
% The fuzzy system has five rules. The first three rules adjust the valve
% based on only the water level error.
%
% * If the water level is okay, then do not adjust the valve.
% * If the water level is low, then open the valve quickly.
% * If the water level is high, then close the valve quickly.
%
% The other two rules adjust the valve based on the rate of change of the
% water level when the water level is near the setpoint.
%
% * If the water level is okay and increasing, then close the valve slowly.
% * If the water level is okay and decreasing, then open the valve slowly.

%%
% In this model, you can also control the water level using a PID
% controller. To switch to the PID controller, set the const block to a
% value greater than or equal to zero.

%% Simulation
% The model simulates the controller with periodic changes in the setpoint
% of the water level. Run the simulation.
sim('sltank',100)
open_system('sltank/Comparison')

%%
% The water level tracks the setpoint well. You can adjust the performance
% of the controller by modifying the rules of the |tank| FIS. For example,
% if you remove the last two rules, which are analogous to a derivative
% control action, the controller performs poorly, with large oscillations
% in the water level.
